# check the docker is installed in the server 
docker --version

# Hello world
docker run hello-world
	1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 	2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
       (arm64v8)
 	3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
       executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 	4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
       to your terminal.

# check the running containers now
docker ps

# check the container we ran so far
docker ps -a

# check the images we have 
docker image ls

# remove docker image 
# remove containers before removing the image 
docker rm (container id) 
docker rmi (imageid or name)

# pull images
docker image pull ubuntu

# run ubuntu in current terminal (-it)
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash

# do what ever the things inside the container 

# You need to create a image from the updates container
docker commit container-name new-imagename:tag
# in here it will create a image without name or tag you can see that by checking all the images
docker images -a

# now you can run the customized image by image-name 

# push the image to docker hub
docker login 
docker push image-name
